Much of it is very good, but I find there is a lack of material focusing on getting a feeling for a concept separate from the math or mechanics of the process. When there is, it is rarely interactive. There is Brilliant.org, but is behind a paywall.</p> <p>My goal with this blog is to take a problem-driven approach to mathematical discovery through starting from something simple or well understood and building up in natural-feeling steps to an intuitive understanding of the problem. My experience has been that if you work through material and try to visualize what is going on, you remember it better, and can apply it more broadly than if you just memorize how to perform a set of tasks.</p> <p>This is a blog primarily about math and computer science, but I may also include other topics from time to time, such as electrical engineering, physics, and music theory.</p>"},{"location":"tags/","title":"Tags","text":""},{"location":"tags/#computer-graphics","title":"Computer Graphics","text":"<ul> <li>M\u00f6ller\u2013Trumbore: Photorealistic Lighting Starts With a Ray and a Triangle</li> <li>Splines 1: A Spline-Tingling Idea</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#linear-algebra","title":"Linear Algebra","text":"<ul> <li>M\u00f6ller\u2013Trumbore: Photorealistic Lighting Starts With a Ray and a Triangle</li> <li>Splines 1: A Spline-Tingling Idea</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#some","title":"SoME","text":"<ul> <li>M\u00f6ller\u2013Trumbore: Photorealistic Lighting Starts With a Ray and a Triangle</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#some3","title":"SoME3","text":"<ul> <li>M\u00f6ller\u2013Trumbore: Photorealistic Lighting Starts With a Ray and a Triangle</li> </ul>"},{"location":"2023/07/13/improved-blogging-experience/","title":"Improved Blogging Experience","text":"<p>MkDocs Material (the amazing MkDocs theme that powers this site) has hit their $12,000 goal, which means they have made their blogging platform available to non-insiders! It is still in beta, but I decided to go for it anyway, because I really wanted my blog to feel more like a real blog.</p> <p>There is one wrinkle: it is not compatible with the Jupyter MkDocs plugin I was using, so for now, my old posts (which were Jupyter notebooks) have been taken down. I plan to convert them to Markdown at some point, but for now, the blog just has this one post.</p>"},{"location":"tags/","title":"Tags","text":""},{"location":"tags/#computer-graphics","title":"Computer Graphics","text":"<ul> <li>M\u00f6ller\u2013Trumbore: Photorealistic Lighting Starts With a Ray and a Triangle</li> <li>Splines 1: A Spline-Tingling Idea</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#linear-algebra","title":"Linear Algebra","text":"<ul> <li>M\u00f6ller\u2013Trumbore: Photorealistic Lighting Starts With a Ray and a Triangle</li> <li>Splines 1: A Spline-Tingling Idea</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#some","title":"SoME","text":"<ul> <li>M\u00f6ller\u2013Trumbore: Photorealistic Lighting Starts With a Ray and a Triangle</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#some3","title":"SoME3","text":"<ul> <li>M\u00f6ller\u2013Trumbore: Photorealistic Lighting Starts With a Ray and a Triangle</li> </ul>"}]}
