        <title>Improved Blogging Experience</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<h1 id="improved-blogging-experience">Improved Blogging Experience</h1>
<p><a href="https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material">MkDocs Material</a> (the amazing MkDocs theme that powers this site) has hit their $12,000 goal, which means they have made their blogging platform available to non-insiders! It is still in beta, but I decided to go for it anyway, because I really wanted my blog to feel more like a real blog.</p>
<!-- more -->

<p>There is one wrinkle: it is not compatible with the Jupyter MkDocs plugin I was using, so for now, my old posts (which were Jupyter notebooks) have been taken down. I plan to convert them to Markdown at some point, but for now, the blog just has this one post.</p>]]></description>
