# Improved Blogging Experience

[MkDocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material) (the amazing MkDocs theme that powers this site) has hit their $12,000 goal, which means they have made their blogging platform available to non-insiders! It is still in beta, but I decided to go for it anyway, because I really wanted my blog to feel more like a real blog.

<!-- more -->

There is one wrinkle: it is not compatible with the Jupyter MkDocs plugin I was using, so for now, my old posts (which were Jupyter notebooks) have been taken down. I plan to convert them to Markdown at some point, but for now, the blog just has this one post.
