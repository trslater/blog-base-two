# About This Blog

There is a great deal of traditional math and science education on the internet. Much of it is very good, but I find there is a lack of material focusing on getting a *feeling* for a concept separate from the math or mechanics of the process. When there is, it is rarely interactive. There is Brilliant.org, but is behind a paywall.

My goal with this blog is to take a problem-driven approach to mathematical discovery through starting from something simple or well understood and building up in natural-feeling steps to an intuitive understanding of the problem. My experience has been that if you work through material and try to visualize what is going on, you remember it better, and can apply it more broadly than if you just memorize how to perform a set of tasks.

This is a blog primarily about **math** and **computer science**, but I may also include other topics from time to time, such as electrical engineering, physics, and music theory.
